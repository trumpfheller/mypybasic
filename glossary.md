#### +1 
- A vote in favor of something. (You see it in chats with multiple members when a person agrees with what was said.)

#### A 

##### abstract method
- In object-oriented programming, a method that is defined but not implemented. Programmers will define an abstract method in a parent class to specify operations that child classes must provide.

##### agile development
- A software development methodology that emphasizes lots of small steps and continuous feedback instead of up-front planning and long-term scheduling.

##### algorithm
- An algorithm is a set of steps, intructions, or rules to be followed to accomplish a specific task. In computer science, an algorithm is a set of instructions in a computer program that solves a computational problem.

##### Application Programming Interface (API)
- A set of functions and procedures provided by one software library or web service through which another application can communicate with it. An API is not the code, the database, or the server: it’s the access point.

##### assertion
- A Boolean expression that must be true at a certain point in a program.

##### Assignment 
 - A statement that assigns a vlaue to a variable.



#### B

##### backpropagation
- An algorithm that iteratively adjusts the weights used in a neural network. 
- Backpropagation is often used to implement gradient descent.

##### base case
- A conditional brnach in a recursive function that does not make a recursive call.

##### Bayes' Theorem
- An equation for calculating the probability that something is true if something related to it is true. 

##### Boolean
- Relating to a variable or data type that can have either a logical value of true or false. Named for George Boole, a 19th century mathematician.

##### boolean expression
 - value is either TRUE or FALSE
  
#### C
 
##### Concatenate
 - Join two operants end-to-end.
  
#### D

##### debug
- process of finding and resolving errors (also known as ‘bugs’).

##### delimiter
 - A character or string used to indicate where a string should be split.

##### constructor
- A function that creates an object of a particular class.

##### data encapsulating
 - propgram development plan that involves protoype using global variables and a final version that makes the global variables into isnance attributes.

#### E

##### expression 
- A combination of variables, operators and values that represent one single value.
  
#### F
 
##### floating point
 - A type that represents numbers with fractional parts.

##### for loop
- A construct in a program that repeats one or more other statements (the loop body) once for each item in a sequence, such as each number in a range or each element of a list.

#### G
 
##### global variable
 - definded outside of the function
 - can be accessed from any function 
  
#### H
 
##### hashable
 - A type that has a hash function. Immutable types like integers, floats, and strings are hashable; mutable type like lists and dictionaries are not.
 
##### High level language
 - Programming language like Python that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write (check low level language)

#### I 
##### Interpreter
- A program that reads anotuer program and executes it.

#### J


#### K

##### key
- An object that appears in a dictionary as the first part of key-value pair

##### key-value pair
- representation of the mapping from a ...something

#### L 

##### list
- A vector that can contain values of many different (heterogeneous) types.

##### list comprehension
- In Python, an expression that creates a new list in place. For example, [2*x for x in values] creates a new list whose items are the doubles of those in values.

##### logical operator
- operator that comnbines boolean expression: and, or, and not.

##### loop
- A structure that repeatedly executes a section of code until a specific exit condition is met.

##### Low level language
 - A programming langauge that is designed to be east for a computer to run, also called machien language or assembley language. 

#### M 

##### modulus operator
- An operator, denoted with a percent sign, that works on integers and returns the remainder when on number is devided by another. 

#### N 

##### nested conditional 
- A conditional staement that appears in one of the branches of another conditinal statement. 

#### O 

##### Operand
- One of the values on which an operator operates.

#### P 

##### persistent
- Pertaining to a program that runs indefinitly and keeps at least some if its data in permanent storage. 

#### Q 

##### quadratic
 - An algorithm whose runtime is proportional to n power of 2, where n is a measure of problem size.


#### R 

##### return statement
 - A statement that causes a function to end immediatly and returns to the caller. 

#### S 

##### syntax error
 - error in a prgram that makes it impossible to parse (and therefore impossible to interpret)
 
#### T 
 
##### type
- A category of values.
- integrers (type int)
- floating-point number (type float)
- strings (type str)

#### U
##### Unicode 
- [unicode](https://www.unicode.org/) 
- a specification that aims to list every character used by human languages and give each character its own unique code. 

#### V

##### veneer
 - a method or function that provides a different interface to another function without doing much computation. 

#### W
 
##### w
- 'w' flag truncates the file if it already exists: if the file contents exists it will be replaced.
 - opens in write-only mode. The pointer is placed at the beginning of the file and this will overwrite any existing file with the same name. It will create a new file if one with the same name doesn't exist.

#### X 
  
#####
 - 
 
#### Y 
  
#####

#### Z

### Zen of Python
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.
- Now is better than never.
